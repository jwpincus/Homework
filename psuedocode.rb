# start an input and response loop
    #get an input from the user
    # process the input from the user  
    #if the string is empty then response should be hello
    #if the string has a lower case letter in it respond with "I AM HAVING A HARD TIME HEARING YOU."
    #if the string is in uppercase and not "GOODBYE!" respond "NO, THIS IS NOT A PET STORE"
    #if the string is "GOODBYE!" the first time respond with "ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH?"
    #if the string is "GOODBYE!" again respond with "THANK YOU FOR CALLING!" then end the loop
